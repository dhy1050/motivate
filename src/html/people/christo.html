            <h2 class="lead-text">CHRISTO CLAASSENS, SENIOR EXPERIENCE DESIGNER</h2>
            <p>With 15+ years of creating online experiences, Christo still likes to learn nerdy things about design. He revels in championing user needs, canâ€™t get enough of usability testing, and mashes this together to create simple experiences. Christo is a new dad and can't wait to teach his son Andries the finer nuances of South African culture: speaking Afrikaans, drinking beer, eating biltong and playing rugby.</p>
