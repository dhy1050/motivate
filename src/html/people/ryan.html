          <h2 class="lead-text">RYAN HORGAN, DESIGN RESEARCHER</h2>
          <p>Driven by his desire to understand the motivations behind human behavior and thought processes, Ryan loves to get himself into other people's headspace. His keen ability to empathize, coupled with his love for challenging puzzles, pack a one-two punch as a qualitative researcher and problem solver. Traveling is one of Ryan’s greatest passions; not just for the experience of seeing the world, but also for the opportunity to meet people and immerse himself in cultures outside his own. With his friends from all over the world, he loves to analyze the differences and similarities that exist in the view points and mindsets of people from vastly different walks of life; and then break down the culture barriers and just have a great time. In his free time, Ryan enjoys orchestrating Chopped cooking challenges with friends, coaching swim team, and indulging in anything to do with Spain. Ryan holds a B.A. in Psychology from The Catholic University of America in Washington D.C. where he was a suicidolgy researcher for one of the top suicide prevention laboratories in the country.</p>
