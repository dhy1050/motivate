          <p>PHHHOTO needed to develop a support solution that provides clients with 24-hour access to immediate, high-quality assistance that gets them up and running quickly to avoid stress and maximize PHHHOTO taking. Currently, on-site setup is available to most clients, and the production team has been able to handle support until now. The PHHHOTO team applied our problem-solving techniques to come up with an actionable solution.</p>

       <h5 class="tiny-header h-reframe-color">PHHHOTO IS</h5>
      <p>A start-up company offering a social media camera app that’s really fun to use. Also, it’s an iPad-based photobooth app that we rent out for marketing events and parties.</p>
       <h5 class="tiny-header h-reframe-color">I DECIDED TO DO A WIT STUDIO BECAUSE</h5>
      <p>We were stuck. If PHHHOTO could provide quality, remote customer support, we would save time and money, increasing customer satisfaction and allowing more clients to have PHHHOTO at their events.</p>

          <h5 class="tiny-header h-reframe-color">TO START THE WIT STUDIO</h5>
          <p>We completed the Empathy and Problempathy Maps. We thought it was funny to put ourselves in different positions; Especially putting ourselves in the shoes of the app because, like anything in tech, it does have some problems and is intended to fun and delightful.</p>

          <h5 class="tiny-header h-reframe-color">DURING THE WIT STUDIO</h5>
          <p>We learned that solving this problem surpisingly easy. After brainstorming on solutions, it was easy to group the ideas into themes: Internet outsourcing, 24-hour phone & text support and FaceTime Set-up. We felt like these themes were so obvious that there was nothing to do but move forward with the ideas.</p>
